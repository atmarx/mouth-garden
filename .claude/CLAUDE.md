## Project Overview

**"Tending Your Mouth Garden: What the Tooth Fairy Has Been Trying to Tell You"** is a ~70,000-word book about oral health written from an ecological perspective. The core thesis is that the mouth is an ecosystem to be nurtured, not a battlefield to be sterilized.

### The Voice

The entire book is narrated by **the Tooth Fairy**—an ancient, weary being who has collected teeth for millennia and desperately wants humans to keep theirs. The voice is:

- **Warm but exasperated** — genuinely cares, but tired of watching the same mistakes
- **Scientifically rigorous** — cites research, explains mechanisms, acknowledges uncertainty
- **Accessible** — avoids jargon where possible, explains it where necessary
- **Occasionally sarcastic** — dry humor, especially about human dental negligence
- **Reverent toward plants** — speaks of botanical remedies with tenderness and respect

When writing new content or editing existing content, maintain this voice consistently.

### Key Themes

1. **Ecological thinking** — The oral microbiome is mostly beneficial; indiscriminate killing (antiseptic mouthwash) creates dysbiosis
2. **Remineralization** — Teeth can heal early-stage decay if conditions are right
3. **Evidence-based traditionalism** — Many folk remedies have real mechanisms; validate with science
4. **Frequency over quantity** — For sugar/acid, how often matters more than how much
5. **Integration, not replacement** — Natural approaches complement, not replace, professional care

## File Structure

### Source of Truth: `manuscript/`

All content lives in `manuscript/`. The folder structure is:

```
manuscript/
├── 00-frontmatter/
│   ├── 00-foreword.md      # Author's foreword (human voice, not Tooth Fairy)
│   ├── 00-title.md         # Title page
│   ├── 01-preface.md       # Tooth Fairy's confession
│   └── 02-introduction.md  # Why your teeth keep losing
├── 01-part-one/            # Foundations (Ch. 1-4)
├── 02-part-two/            # History (Ch. 5-7)
├── 03-part-three/          # Enemies (Ch. 8-10)
├── 04-part-four/           # Chemistry (Ch. 11-13)
├── 05-part-five/           # Delivery (Ch. 14-16)
├── 06-part-six/            # Botanicals (Ch. 17-24)
├── 07-part-seven/          # Innovations (Ch. 25-27)
├── 08-part-eight/          # Bigger Picture (Ch. 28-29)
├── 09-part-nine/           # Living It (Ch. 30-33)
└── 10-appendices/          # Appendices A-D
```

Each part folder contains:

- `00-part-intro.md` — Brief part introduction
- `01-chapter-name.md`, `02-chapter-name.md`, etc. — Chapters in order

### Generated Folders (Don't Edit Directly)

- `docs/` — Generated by `mkdocs-build.sh prepare` for MkDocs
- `site/` — Generated by `mkdocs build` (static HTML)
- `combined/` — Generated by `build.sh combine` (single Markdown file)
- `output/` — Generated by `build.sh` (PDF, EPUB, DOCX)

### Key Configuration Files

- `mkdocs.yml` — MkDocs site configuration, navigation structure
- `mkdocs-build.sh` — Build script with venv management and file mapping
- `metadata.yaml` — Pandoc configuration for PDF/EPUB generation
- `build.sh` — Pandoc build script

---

## Build Commands

### MkDocs (Website)

```bash
./mkdocs-build.sh setup     # First time: create venv, install deps
./mkdocs-build.sh serve     # Start dev server at http://127.0.0.1:8000
./mkdocs-build.sh build     # Build static site to site/
./mkdocs-build.sh prepare   # Just sync manuscript → docs/
./mkdocs-build.sh clean     # Remove docs/ and site/
```

### Pandoc (PDF/EPUB)

```bash
./build.sh pdf      # Generate PDF
./build.sh epub     # Generate EPUB
./build.sh all      # All formats
./build.sh combine  # Just merge manuscript files
```

---

## Editing Workflow

1. Edit files in `manuscript/`
2. Run `./mkdocs-build.sh serve` to preview
3. Changes to manuscript require re-running `prepare` (or the serve command does it automatically if docs/ doesn't exist)

### File Naming in `mkdocs-build.sh`

The build script maps manuscript files to SEO-friendly docs paths. The mapping is defined in two associative arrays:

- `FOLDER_MAP` — Maps manuscript folders to docs folders
- `FILE_MAP` — Maps individual files to new names

If you add a new chapter, you must update both `mkdocs.yml` (navigation) and `mkdocs-build.sh` (file mapping).

## Content Guidelines

### Scientific Claims

- **Tier 1 (strong evidence)**: Fluoride, chlorhexidine, xylitol — state confidently
- **Tier 2 (moderate evidence)**: n-HAp, propolis, green tea, oil pulling — present positively with caveats
- **Tier 3 (promising but limited)**: Most essential oils, many botanicals — "preliminary research suggests"
- **Tier 4 (traditional use only)**: Minimal modern research — "traditionally used for"
- **Tier 5 (unlikely/disproven)**: Activated charcoal for whitening — note lack of evidence

Always acknowledge uncertainty where it exists. The Tooth Fairy is scientifically honest.

### Formatting Conventions

- Use `**bold**` for key terms on first introduction
- Use `*italics*` for emphasis, species names (*Salvadora persica*)
- Use `>` blockquotes for Tooth Fairy asides/commentary
- Tables for comparisons, formulations, protocols
- Markdown headers: `#` for chapter title, `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections

### Chapter Structure

Most chapters follow this pattern:

1. **Opening hook** — Often a Tooth Fairy observation or complaint
2. **Core content** — Science, history, practical information
3. **Practical takeaways** — What to actually do
4. **Transition** — Bridge to next chapter

---

## Common Tasks

### Adding a New Chapter

1. Create file in appropriate `manuscript/XX-part-X/` folder
2. Add to `FILE_MAP` in `mkdocs-build.sh`
3. Add to `nav:` in `mkdocs.yml`
4. Run `./mkdocs-build.sh prepare` to generate docs/

### Updating Formulations (Appendix A)

File: `manuscript/10-appendices/01-appendix-a-formulations.md`

Contains practical recipes. When updating:

- Keep measurements precise
- Include safety warnings
- Note shelf life
- Cross-reference relevant chapters

### Updating Glossary (Appendix B)

File: `manuscript/10-appendices/02-appendix-b-glossary.md`

Alphabetical entries. Each entry should include:

- What it is
- How it works (mechanism)
- Evidence level
- Forms available
- Cautions if any

## Project History

This project was created in December 2024 through collaboration between Andrew (human author) and Claude (AI assistant). The initial manuscript was developed over multiple sessions covering:

1. Oral health science foundations
2. Remineralization chemistry
3. Microbiome ecology
4. Botanical remedies research
5. Historical oral care practices
6. Modern innovations (n-HAp, probiotics)
7. Practical protocol development

The MkDocs website and build system were developed to make the content accessible and maintainable.

## Questions?

If you're a Claude instance working on this project and something is unclear, check:

1. `README.md` — Project overview and build instructions
2. `TODO.md` — Known issues and planned improvements
3. The manuscript files themselves — often contain context in their content
4. `mkdocs.yml` — Site structure and navigation

When in doubt, maintain the Tooth Fairy voice and prioritize scientific accuracy.
