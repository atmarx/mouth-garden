## Project Overview

**"Keep Your Teeth: What the Tooth Fairy Has Been Trying to Tell You"** is an oral health resource written from an ecological perspective. The core thesis is that the mouth is an ecosystem to be nurtured, not a battlefield to be sterilized.

- **Website:** [keepyourteeth.org](https://keepyourteeth.org)
- **Repository:** [github.com/atmarx/keep-your-teeth](https://github.com/atmarx/keep-your-teeth)

### The Voice

The entire book is narrated by **the Tooth Fairy**—an ancient, weary being who has collected teeth for millennia and desperately wants humans to keep theirs. The voice is:

- **Warm but exasperated** — genuinely cares, but tired of watching the same mistakes
- **Scientifically rigorous** — cites research, explains mechanisms, acknowledges uncertainty
- **Accessible** — avoids jargon where possible, explains it where necessary
- **Occasionally sarcastic** — dry humor, especially about human dental negligence
- **Reverent toward plants** — speaks of botanical remedies with tenderness and respect

The **foreword** is the only section in the human author's voice.

When writing new content or editing existing content, maintain the Tooth Fairy voice consistently.

### Key Themes

1. **Ecological thinking** — The oral microbiome is mostly beneficial; indiscriminate killing (antiseptic mouthwash) creates dysbiosis
2. **Remineralization** — Teeth can heal early-stage decay if conditions are right
3. **Evidence-based traditionalism** — Many folk remedies have real mechanisms; validate with science
4. **Frequency over quantity** — For sugar/acid, how often matters more than how much
5. **Integration, not replacement** — Natural approaches complement, not replace, professional care

### Generated Folder (Don't Edit)

- `site/` — Generated by `mkdocs build` (static HTML for deployment)

### Key Configuration Files

- `mkdocs.yml` — MkDocs site configuration and navigation
- `mkdocs-build.sh` — Build script with venv management
- `requirements.txt` — Python dependencies

---

## Build Commands

```bash
./mkdocs-build.sh setup     # First time: create venv, install deps
./mkdocs-build.sh serve     # Start dev server at http://127.0.0.1:8000
./mkdocs-build.sh build     # Build static site to site/
./mkdocs-build.sh clean     # Remove site/ directory
./mkdocs-build.sh shell     # Open shell with venv activated
```

---

## Editing Workflow

1. Edit files directly in `docs/`
2. Run `./mkdocs-build.sh serve` to preview
3. The dev server auto-reloads on file changes

### Adding a New Chapter

1. Create the `.md` file in the appropriate `docs/` subfolder
2. Add to `nav:` section in `mkdocs.yml`
3. Verify with `./mkdocs-build.sh serve`

## Content Guidelines

### Scientific Claims

Use tiered language based on evidence strength:

| Tier | Evidence Level | Language |
|------|----------------|----------|
| 1 | Strong (systematic reviews, multiple RCTs) | "Research shows..." |
| 2 | Moderate (RCTs, good cohort studies) | "Evidence suggests..." |
| 3 | Promising but limited (small studies, in vitro) | "Preliminary research indicates..." |
| 4 | Traditional use only | "Traditionally used for..." |
| 5 | Unlikely or disproven | "Despite claims, evidence does not support..." |

Always acknowledge uncertainty where it exists. The Tooth Fairy is scientifically honest.

### Formatting Conventions

- Use `**bold**` for key terms on first introduction
- Use `*italics*` for emphasis, species names (*Salvadora persica*)
- Use `>` blockquotes for Tooth Fairy asides/commentary
- Tables for comparisons, formulations, protocols
- Markdown headers: `#` for chapter title, `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections
- Footnotes use `[^1]` syntax with definitions at end of file

### Chapter Structure

Most chapters follow this pattern:

1. **Opening hook** — Often a Tooth Fairy observation or complaint
2. **Core content** — Science, history, practical information
3. **Practical takeaways** — What to actually do
4. **Transition** — Bridge to next chapter

## Project History

This project was created in December 2024 through collaboration between Andrew Marx (human author) and Claude (AI assistant). The content evolved through multiple iterations:

- **December 2024:** Initial manuscript development
- **January 2025:** MkDocs website build, footnote system, image placeholders
- **January 2025:** Added pregnancy, elderly, children, and bruxism chapters
- **January 2025:** Renamed from "Beyond the Burn" → "Mouth Garden" → "Keep Your Teeth"

## Questions?

If you're a Claude instance working on this project and something is unclear, check:

1. `README.md` — Project overview and quick start
2. `TODO.md` — Known issues and planned improvements
3. `CONTRIBUTING.md` — Contribution guidelines
4. `mkdocs.yml` — Site structure and navigation

When in doubt, maintain the Tooth Fairy voice and prioritize scientific accuracy.
