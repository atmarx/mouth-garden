# Chapter 24: Modern Trends — Charcoal, Coconut, and Marketing

We've spent the last several chapters exploring botanical remedies with centuries or millennia of traditional use, most of which have been at least partially validated by modern science. Now let's turn to the opposite phenomenon: modern trends that leverage the *aesthetics* of natural health without necessarily delivering the substance.

I've watched humans fall for marketing for as long as there has been marketing. But the current era—with its Instagram influencers, "clean beauty" movements, and algorithmically-amplified trends—has created a particularly fertile ground for products that promise natural solutions while often delivering confusion, wasted money, or occasionally actual harm.

Let me walk you through some current trends with my honest assessment of each.

## Activated Charcoal: The Black Paste Problem

Nothing in recent oral care has been more visually striking—or more scientifically concerning—than the rise of activated charcoal toothpastes and treatments. The images are arresting: people brushing with jet-black paste, grinning with temporarily blackened teeth, promising dramatic whitening results.

The pitch is seductive: activated charcoal is "natural" (it's carbon, after all), has legitimate uses in medicine (poison adsorption, emergency toxicology), and its porosity gives it remarkable surface area for binding substances. Surely those properties translate to oral health?

Let's examine the reality.

### What Activated Charcoal Actually Does

**The legitimate properties:**
- Enormous surface area (500-3,000 m² per gram)
- Excellent adsorption of organic molecules
- Used medically to bind toxins in overdose situations
- FDA-approved for specific medical indications

**The oral health claims:**
- Whitens teeth by adsorbing stains
- Removes toxins from the mouth
- Freshens breath by binding odor compounds
- "Natural" alternative to peroxide whitening

### The Evidence (or Lack Thereof)

A 2017 systematic review in the *Journal of the American Dental Association* examined all available evidence on charcoal dental products. The conclusion was damning:

> "There is insufficient clinical and laboratory data to substantiate the safety and efficacy claims of charcoal and charcoal-based dentifrices."

The authors found:
- **No controlled clinical trials** demonstrating whitening efficacy
- **No studies** examining long-term safety
- **Concern about abrasivity** damaging enamel
- **Potential interference** with fluoride (charcoal may adsorb the fluoride from toothpaste, negating its benefit)

A 2019 study in the *British Dental Journal* tested five charcoal toothpastes and found:
- High variability in charcoal content
- Several products had abrasivity levels high enough to damage enamel with regular use
- No evidence of superior stain removal compared to conventional toothpastes

### My Specific Concerns

**Abrasivity:**
Relative Dentin Abrasivity (RDA) is the standard measure of toothpaste abrasiveness. The ADA recommends RDA below 250 for daily use; most regular toothpastes are 70-150. Many charcoal toothpastes have never been tested, and those that have often show high RDA values.

Enamel doesn't regenerate. Every particle of enamel you abrade away is gone forever. Using a highly abrasive paste to remove surface stains may create a briefly whiter appearance while permanently thinning the enamel—revealing the yellower dentin beneath and increasing sensitivity and decay risk.

**Fluoride interference:**
Charcoal is excellent at adsorbing organic molecules—including fluoride ions. If your charcoal toothpaste also contains fluoride (some do, marketed as "best of both worlds"), the charcoal may simply bind the fluoride before it can contact your teeth. You get neither the charcoal benefits (unproven) nor the fluoride benefits (well-proven).

**False confidence:**
The dramatic visual of black paste and the "natural" marketing may lead people to believe they're doing something special for their oral health, when they may actually be doing harm while neglecting proven approaches.

### My Verdict

**Activated charcoal toothpaste is not recommended.** The evidence for benefit is absent, the evidence for potential harm is concerning, and the marketing preys on the understandable desire for "natural" solutions without delivering substantive value.

If you want whiter teeth, there are safer approaches:
- Reduce staining substances (coffee, tea, wine, tobacco)
- Brush with standard toothpaste after consuming them
- Peroxide-based whitening (has actual evidence, though different safety considerations)
- Professional cleaning and whitening through a dentist

If you want "natural" oral care, you've already read about options that actually work: salt, baking soda, green tea, neem, proper botanical preparations.

The charcoal trend will pass. Your enamel needs to last forever.

## Coconut Oil Toothpaste: Better Than Charcoal, But Questions Remain

The popularity of coconut oil in oral care has two distinct manifestations: oil pulling (discussed in the previous chapter, with reasonable evidence) and coconut oil toothpaste (more mixed).

### The Claims

Coconut oil toothpaste proponents argue:
- Lauric acid provides antimicrobial protection
- The oil base is gentler than detergent-based conventional pastes
- "Chemical-free" (a meaningless term—everything is chemicals)
- Can be made at home with simple ingredients

### The Reality

**Lauric acid is genuinely antimicrobial.** Laboratory studies confirm activity against oral pathogens including *S. mutans*. However, whether the concentration in toothpaste provides meaningful clinical benefit during the brief contact time of brushing is unestablished.

**The lack of fluoride is the main concern.** Most coconut oil toothpastes don't contain fluoride—either because the manufacturers are ideologically opposed, or because formulating stable fluoride in an oil base is technically challenging. 

If you're in a category where fluoride is particularly important (high caries risk, children with developing teeth, dry mouth), substituting coconut oil toothpaste for fluoride toothpaste may increase your cavity risk.

**DIY formulations vary wildly.** The internet is full of recipes for homemade coconut oil toothpaste, typically combining:
- Coconut oil
- Baking soda
- Essential oils (peppermint, etc.)
- Sometimes added charcoal (problems already discussed)

These can range from reasonable (coconut oil + baking soda is essentially oil pulling plus pH buffering in a paste form) to problematic (adding abrasives, using excessive essential oils, etc.).

### My Verdict

**Coconut oil toothpaste is acceptable as a supplement but problematic as a sole dentifrice.** If you want to use it:

- Continue using fluoride toothpaste at least once daily
- Use coconut oil toothpaste for the other brushing if desired
- Avoid formulations with charcoal or high-abrasive additions
- Recognize that you're trading proven benefit (fluoride, detergent cleaning) for plausible but less-proven benefit (lauric acid)

The better integration is oil pulling (where the extended contact time makes more sense for oil-based antimicrobial action) plus conventional or n-HAp toothpaste for brushing.

## "Natural" Toothpaste: What the Label Means (and Doesn't)

The word "natural" on oral care products is essentially meaningless from a regulatory standpoint. There is no FDA definition, no required standard, no certification process. Any product can claim to be natural.

### Common "Natural" Toothpaste Ingredients

| Ingredient | What It Does | Actually Natural? | Evidence Base |
|------------|--------------|-------------------|---------------|
| Sodium bicarbonate | pH buffer, mild abrasive | Yes (mined or synthesized) | Good |
| Xylitol | Sweetener, antimicrobial | Derived from plants | Good |
| Calcium carbonate | Abrasive | Yes (mined) | Modest |
| Hydrated silica | Abrasive | Processed from sand | Moderate |
| Glycerin | Humectant | Plant or synthetic | Safe, neutral for teeth |
| Sodium lauryl sulfate | Detergent/foaming | Derived from coconut | Safe, some sensitivity issues |
| Essential oils | Antimicrobial, flavor | Plant-derived | Variable |
| Stevia | Sweetener | Plant-derived | Safe, neutral |
| Carrageenan | Thickener | Seaweed-derived | Safe (oral use) |
| "Natural flavors" | Flavor | Can mean almost anything | Unspecified |

### The Fluoride Question in "Natural" Products

Many consumers seeking "natural" toothpaste are specifically avoiding fluoride, based on concerns ranging from legitimate (fluorosis risk with excessive ingestion during tooth development) to conspiratorial (government mind control, etc.).

I want to be clear: **fluoride is the single most evidence-supported intervention for caries prevention.** Topical fluoride (in toothpaste) has an excellent safety profile and strong efficacy data. The concerns about fluoride toxicity apply to systemic ingestion, not topical oral use in adults.

If you choose a fluoride-free "natural" toothpaste, you should:
- Have another source of topical fluoride (rinse, professional application)
- OR accept increased caries risk
- OR be in a genuinely low-risk category (excellent diet, robust saliva, no history of caries, using n-HAp as alternative)

Choosing "natural" without understanding these trade-offs is how people end up with cavities while congratulating themselves on avoiding "chemicals."

## The Microbiome Oral Care Trend

A newer wave of products claims to support the oral microbiome—essentially the marketing application of the ecological paradigm I've been describing throughout this book. This is... complicated, because the underlying science is sound but the product applications are often premature.

### The Legitimate Science

Everything I've told you about the oral ecosystem, the problems with scorched-earth antiseptics, the importance of beneficial bacteria—all of that is well-supported by research. The microbiome revolution is real.

### The Premature Products

Translating microbiome science into effective consumer products is much harder than it sounds:

**Probiotic toothpastes and rinses:** We discussed oral probiotics earlier. The challenge is delivering viable organisms in shelf-stable products at sufficient doses to meaningfully colonize. Most products either can't demonstrate survival or can't demonstrate oral colonization.

**Prebiotic oral care:** The idea of providing substrates that beneficial bacteria prefer. Arginine-containing toothpastes are the legitimate version of this. But many "prebiotic" marketing claims are vague and unstudied.

**"Microbiome-friendly" positioning:** Sometimes this just means "not antibacterial"—which is fine, but hardly revolutionary. Your salt and baking soda rinse is microbiome-friendly too, and costs pennies.

### My Verdict

**Be skeptical of microbiome marketing; the science is outpacing the products.** The ecological approach to oral care doesn't require buying expensive new products—it requires understanding your mouth and using simple tools wisely.

The best "microbiome-friendly" oral care is what we've already discussed:
- Avoid antiseptic mouthwashes for routine use
- Use gentle, pH-supportive rinses
- Include arginine if you want prebiotic benefit
- Consider proven oral probiotics (*S. salivarius* K12/M18)
- Focus on diet and timing over products

## Wellness Culture and Oral Health: The Bigger Picture

I've lived long enough to watch health trends cycle through again and again. Some observations:

**The pendulum always swings too far.** The rejection of "chemicals" and embrace of "natural" is in many ways a healthy correction to the over-medicalized, antiseptic-obsessed approach of the late 20th century. But it swings past the optimum when it rejects genuinely beneficial interventions (fluoride) while embracing unproven ones (charcoal).

**Marketing exploits genuine intuitions.** Your instinct that gentle, ecologically-aware approaches might be better than burning alcohol rinses is *correct*. The problem is that marketers exploit that correct instinct to sell products that don't deliver on the promise.

**Tradition has value, but isn't automatically right.** The miswak tradition works because the plant contains genuinely beneficial compounds. Other traditions (bloodletting, mercury treatments) didn't work. The question is always: what's the mechanism, and what's the evidence?

**The best solutions are often boring.** Salt, baking soda, green tea, xylitol, proper technique, attention to diet and timing. These aren't exciting. They don't photograph well. They don't generate influencer content. But they work.

## Summary: Separating Signal from Noise

| Trend | Verdict | Reasoning |
|-------|---------|-----------|
| **Activated charcoal** | Avoid | No efficacy evidence; abrasivity concerns |
| **Coconut oil toothpaste** | Acceptable supplement | Missing fluoride; better as oil pulling |
| **"Natural" toothpaste** | Depends on formulation | Read ingredients; don't fear-avoid fluoride |
| **Microbiome products** | Mostly premature | Science is sound; products often aren't |
| **Oil pulling** | Worth trying | Genuine (modest) evidence |
| **Salt/baking soda rinse** | Recommended | Well-supported, cheap, ecological |
| **Green tea consumption** | Recommended | Good evidence, pleasant, easy |
| **Traditional botanicals** | Selective use | Evaluate each on its evidence |

The common thread: simple, well-understood interventions often outperform complex, heavily-marketed products. The most "natural" approach is often the most ancient—and the most boring.

In the next section, we'll turn to modern innovations that actually *do* represent genuine advances: hydroxyapatite, CPP-ACP, and emerging technologies that may define the future of remineralization.
