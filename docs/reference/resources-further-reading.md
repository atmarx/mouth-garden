## Where to Obtain Ingredients

*Note: I don't endorse specific brands. These are categories and suggestions for finding quality ingredients.*

### Salt and Baking Soda

- Unusually cheap products (may be diluted or adulterated)

**Reputable suppliers:**

- Plant Therapy
- Mountain Rose Herbs
- NOW Foods

## Useful Calculators and Tools

### pH Measurement

- pH test strips (available at aquarium shops, pool supply, Amazon)
- Digital pH meters (more accurate; ~$15-50)

### Saliva Testing

**Saliva flow rate:**

- Simple test: Collect saliva for 5 minutes, measure volume
- Normal unstimulated: 0.3-0.5 mL/min
- Below 0.1 mL/min suggests hyposalivation

**Saliva buffering capacity:**

- Commercial kits available (GC Saliva-Check Buffer)

## A Final Thought on Learning

I've been watching your species learn for a very long time. What I've observed is that the best learners aren't those who absorb the most facts, but those who ask the best questions.

Read widely. Follow your curiosity. Be skeptical—of claims from any source, including this book. Update your beliefs when evidence warrants. Share what you learn with others.

The resources listed here are starting points, not endings. The real learning happens when you begin to connect ideas, test them in practice, and develop your own understanding.

Your teeth—and the ecosystem that surrounds them—are worth that effort.
