*This glossary covers the key compounds, botanicals, and materials discussed throughout this book. Entries are organized alphabetically and include chemical information where relevant, mechanisms of action, and evidence levels.*

---

## A

### Activated Charcoal

**What it is:** Carbon that has been processed to have a highly porous surface, dramatically increasing its surface area.

**Claimed mechanism:** Binds to surface stains and toxins through adsorption.

**Evidence for oral health:** Weak. No reliable evidence for whitening efficacy; concerns about abrasivity and potential damage to enamel. May bind beneficial substances including fluoride.

**The Tooth Fairy's verdict:** A modern trend with more marketing than science. If you want whitening, there are safer approaches.

---

### Aloe Vera (*Aloe barbadensis*)

**What it is:** A succulent plant whose inner gel contains polysaccharides, glycoproteins, and various bioactive compounds.

**Mechanisms:** Anti-inflammatory (inhibits prostaglandin synthesis), wound healing (stimulates fibroblast activity), antimicrobial (modest).

**Evidence for oral health:** Moderate. Some clinical trials suggest benefit for gingivitis and aphthous ulcers. More research needed.

**Forms:** Gel (direct application), juice (rinse ingredient), toothpaste additive.

---

### Arginine

**What it is:** A semi-essential amino acid, one of the building blocks of proteins.

**Mechanism:** Substrate for the arginine deiminase system (ADS) in certain oral bacteria. ADS-positive bacteria convert arginine to ornithine, ammonia, and CO₂. The ammonia neutralizes acid, raising plaque pH.

**Evidence for oral health:** Strong. Clinical trials demonstrate reduced caries incidence with arginine-containing toothpastes. This is a genuinely prebiotic approach—you're feeding the beneficial bacteria.

**Products:** Available in some commercial toothpastes (often with calcium carbonate).

---

### Azadirachtin

**What it is:** A complex limonoid compound found in neem (*Azadirachta indica*).

**Mechanism:** Antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory. Disrupts bacterial cell function.

**Evidence for oral health:** Moderate. In vitro activity demonstrated; some clinical trials support benefit for gingivitis. Traditional use is extensive.

**See also:** Neem

---

## B

### Baking Soda (Sodium Bicarbonate, NaHCO₃)

**What it is:** A mild alkaline salt, commonly used in cooking and cleaning.

**Mechanism:** Acts as a pH buffer. When dissolved in water, creates an alkaline environment (pH ~8.3 for saturated solution). Neutralizes acids produced by oral bacteria, raising plaque pH above the critical threshold for demineralization.

**Evidence for oral health:** Good. Toothpastes containing baking soda show plaque reduction and anti-gingivitis effects in clinical trials. As a rinse, mechanism is sound though less studied.

**The Tooth Fairy's note:** This is one of the pillars of the simple rinse I recommend—cheap, effective, and ecologically gentle.

---

### Benzyl Isothiocyanate (BITC)

**What it is:** A sulfur-containing compound found in *Salvadora persica* (miswak) and various plants in the Brassicaceae family (mustard, horseradish).

**Mechanism:** Potent antimicrobial activity. Disrupts bacterial enzymes and membrane function.

**Evidence for oral health:** Strong. This is one of the key active compounds that makes miswak effective. Demonstrated activity against multiple oral pathogens.

**See also:** Miswak, Salvadora persica

---

## C

### Calcium Carbonate (CaCite, Cite)

**What it is:** A mineral salt; the main component of limestone, chalk, and marine shells.

**Mechanism:** Mild abrasive in toothpastes; provides calcium ions (limited, due to low solubility); buffers pH toward alkaline.

**Evidence for oral health:** Moderate as a toothpaste abrasive. As a remineralization agent in rinses, limited by very low water solubility (~15 mg/L). Your saliva already contains more calcium than you'll dissolve from CaCO₃.

**The Tooth Fairy's note:** I include it as an optional ingredient in the basic rinse—it won't hurt, and may contribute mild buffering, but don't expect remineralization miracles.

---

### Calcium Phosphate (various forms)

**What it is:** The family of calcium-phosphate salts that form the mineral basis of teeth and bone.

**Key forms:**
- **Hydroxyapatite [Ca₁₀(PO₄)₆(OH)₂]:** The primary mineral in enamel
- **Fluorapatite [Ca₁₀(PO₄)₆F₂]:** Fluoride-substituted form, more acid-resistant
- **Amorphous Calcium Phosphate (ACP):** Non-crystalline form used in some remineralization products

**Relevance:** These are the minerals you're trying to preserve and rebuild. Understanding their chemistry is central to understanding remineralization.

**See also:** Hydroxyapatite, Remineralization

---

### Casein Phosphopeptide-Amorphous Calcium Phosphate (CPP-ACP)

**What it is:** A milk-derived protein complex bound to amorphous calcium phosphate. Developed at the University of Melbourne.

**Mechanism:** The casein phosphopeptide stabilizes calcium and phosphate in an amorphous (non-crystalline) form, keeping them bioavailable for enamel remineralization. Delivers ions directly to tooth surface.

**Evidence for oral health:** Good. Multiple clinical trials demonstrate efficacy for remineralizing early carious lesions ("white spot" lesions). Best evidence is for use as adjunct to fluoride, not replacement.

**Products:** MI Paste, MI Paste Plus (with fluoride), various toothpastes.

**Caution:** Contains milk protein; not suitable for those with milk allergies.

---

### Catechins

**What it is:** A family of flavonoid compounds found in tea, particularly green tea.

**Key compound:** Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG)

**Mechanisms:** 
- Anti-adhesion (inhibits glucosyltransferase, preventing *S. mutans* from producing sticky glucan matrix)
- Antimicrobial (direct activity at higher concentrations)
- Anti-inflammatory
- Antioxidant

**Evidence for oral health:** Good. Multiple studies demonstrate reduced plaque, reduced *S. mutans* counts, and improved gingival health with green tea consumption.

**See also:** Green tea

---

### Chlorhexidine

**What it is:** A synthetic bisbiguanide antiseptic, available in various concentrations.

**Mechanism:** Broad-spectrum antimicrobial. Binds to bacterial cell walls, disrupts membranes, causes leakage of intracellular contents. Has "substantivity"—binds to oral tissues and releases slowly over 8-12 hours.

**Evidence for oral health:** Very strong. The gold standard for reducing plaque and gingivitis. Also effective against oral *Candida*.

**Concerns:** Staining of teeth, altered taste sensation, disruption of beneficial oral bacteria, potential blood pressure effects (by killing nitrate-reducing bacteria), promotes calculus formation.

**The Tooth Fairy's note:** Effective but not ecological. Appropriate for short-term use in specific clinical situations (post-surgery, active periodontitis), but not for daily maintenance in healthy mouths.

---

### Cinnamon (*Cinnamomum* species)

**What it is:** Bark of various *Cinnamomum* trees; the spice you know from cooking.

**Key compound:** Cinnamaldehyde (gives cinnamon its characteristic flavor and smell)

**Mechanisms:** Strong antimicrobial activity (cinnamaldehyde disrupts bacterial membranes); anti-inflammatory; antifungal.

**Evidence for oral health:** Moderate. In vitro studies show strong antimicrobial effects. Clinical studies limited but traditional use is extensive.

**Caution:** Cinnamaldehyde can be irritating to mucosa at high concentrations. Cinnamon oil should be diluted; use sparingly.

---

### Clove (*Syzygium aromaticum*)

**What it is:** Dried flower buds of the clove tree; used as a spice and medicine for millennia.

**Key compound:** Eugenol (70-90% of clove oil)

**Mechanisms:**
- Analgesic (inhibits voltage-gated sodium channels—same mechanism as lidocaine)
- Anti-inflammatory (COX-2 inhibition)
- Antimicrobial (disrupts cell membranes)
- Antioxidant

**Evidence for oral health:** Strong. Eugenol is used in conventional dentistry (zinc oxide eugenol cement, dry socket treatments). FDA has approved clove oil as a topical dental analgesic.

**Use:** Cotton swab application for toothache; dilute in carrier oil for sensitive individuals.

**Caution:** Can cause tissue irritation with prolonged use; do not swallow large amounts.

---

### Coconut Oil

**What it is:** Oil extracted from coconut meat, composed primarily of medium-chain saturated fatty acids.

**Key compound:** Lauric acid (~50% of coconut oil)

**Mechanisms:** Lauric acid has antimicrobial properties; oil may physically trap bacteria; possible saponification with saliva creating soap-like molecules.

**Evidence for oral health:** Moderate. Clinical trials of oil pulling show reduced *S. mutans* counts and gingivitis scores. Mechanism not fully established.

**See also:** Oil pulling

---

## E

### Epigallocatechin Gallate (EGCG)

**See:** Catechins, Green tea

---

### Essential Oils

**What they are:** Concentrated volatile aromatic compounds extracted from plants, typically through steam distillation or cold pressing.

**General mechanisms:** Most essential oils with oral health evidence work through disruption of bacterial cell membranes due to their lipophilic nature and specific active compounds.

**Key essential oils for oral health:**
- Thyme oil (thymol)
- Peppermint oil (menthol)
- Eucalyptus oil (eucalyptol/1,8-cineole)
- Clove oil (eugenol)
- Tea tree oil (terpinen-4-ol)
- Cinnamon oil (cinnamaldehyde)

**Evidence:** Varies by oil. Thymol, eucalyptol, and menthol are used in commercial mouthwashes (Listerine) with strong evidence base.

**Cautions:** Essential oils are potent; use sparingly. Many are toxic if swallowed in quantity. Do not use undiluted on mucosa. Require emulsifier to mix with water.

---

### Eucalyptol (1,8-Cineole)

**What it is:** A monoterpenoid compound found in eucalyptus oil and many other plants.

**Mechanism:** Disrupts bacterial cell membranes; anti-inflammatory.

**Evidence for oral health:** Strong. One of the four active ingredients in Listerine; extensive clinical trial support for plaque and gingivitis reduction in that context.

---

### Eugenol

**See:** Clove

---

## F

### Fluoride

**What it is:** The ionic form of fluorine, typically encountered as sodium fluoride (NaF), stannous fluoride (SnF₂), or sodium monofluorophosphate (MFP).

**Mechanisms:**
- Incorporates into enamel crystal, replacing hydroxyl groups
- Creates fluorapatite, which is more acid-resistant than hydroxyapatite
- Fluorapatite has a lower critical pH (~4.5 vs 5.5)
- Enhances remineralization rate
- At higher concentrations, has antimicrobial effects

**Evidence for oral health:** Very strong. Decades of population-level evidence. Fluoride toothpaste is the single most evidence-supported intervention for caries prevention.

**The Tooth Fairy's note:** I've been watching your species for millennia, and fluoride is one of the genuine breakthroughs. You don't have to use it—the alternatives in this book are real—but the evidence is undeniable.

---

### Fluorapatite

**What it is:** The fluoride-substituted form of hydroxyapatite [Ca₁₀(PO₄)₆F₂].

**Significance:** More acid-resistant than hydroxyapatite; critical pH is ~4.5 instead of 5.5. This is why fluoride exposure makes teeth more resistant to decay.

**See also:** Fluoride, Hydroxyapatite

---

## G

### Ginger (*Zingiber officinale*)

**What it is:** The rhizome (underground stem) of the ginger plant; used as spice and medicine worldwide.

**Key compounds:** Gingerols (fresh ginger), shogaols (dried/cooked ginger)

**Mechanisms:**
- Anti-inflammatory (inhibits COX and LOX pathways)
- Antimicrobial (modest; disrupts membranes)
- Antioxidant
- Stimulates saliva flow

**Evidence for oral health:** Moderate. Mostly in vitro and animal studies; some small clinical trials suggest benefit for gingivitis. Anti-inflammatory mechanism well-established from other applications.

**Use:** Tea (simmer sliced ginger), fresh slices applied to gums, or as part of rinse formulations.

---

### Glycyrrhizin

**What it is:** The main sweet-tasting compound in licorice root (*Glycyrrhiza glabra*).

**Mechanisms:** Anti-inflammatory, antiviral, some antimicrobial activity.

**Caution:** Chronic high-dose ingestion can cause hypertension and hypokalemia. Topical oral use is likely safe.

**See also:** Licorice

---

### Green Tea (*Camellia sinensis*)

**What it is:** Tea made from unoxidized leaves of the tea plant.

**Key compounds:** Catechins, especially EGCG; also contains fluoride naturally.

**Evidence for oral health:** Good. Multiple clinical studies demonstrate reduced plaque, reduced *S. mutans*, and improved gingival health. Drinking unsweetened green tea is an evidence-based oral health behavior.

**See also:** Catechins

---

## H

### Hydroxyapatite (HAp)

**What it is:** The primary mineral component of tooth enamel and bone [Ca₁₀(PO₄)₆(OH)₂].

**Structure:** Crystalline lattice of calcium, phosphate, and hydroxyl ions.

**Significance:** Understanding hydroxyapatite chemistry is key to understanding remineralization. The crystal exists in dynamic equilibrium with the surrounding fluid; pH and ion concentrations determine whether it dissolves or rebuilds.

**See also:** Nano-hydroxyapatite, Fluorapatite, Remineralization

---

## L

### Lauric Acid

**What it is:** A 12-carbon saturated fatty acid; comprises ~50% of coconut oil.

**Mechanism:** Antimicrobial activity—disrupts bacterial cell membranes; converted by some bacteria to monolaurin, which has additional antimicrobial properties.

**Evidence for oral health:** Moderate. Part of the rationale for coconut oil pulling. In vitro antimicrobial activity demonstrated.

---

### Licorice (*Glycyrrhiza glabra*, *G. uralensis*)

**What it is:** Root of the licorice plant; used in traditional medicine across Europe and Asia.

**Key compounds:** 
- Glycyrrhizin (sweet taste, anti-inflammatory)
- Licoricidin and licorisoflavan A (antimicrobial, anti-adhesion)

**Mechanisms:** Licoricidin and licorisoflavan A are potent inhibitors of *S. mutans* biofilm formation—they interfere with bacterial adhesion and glucan synthesis.

**Evidence for oral health:** Moderate-good. Studies show reduced *S. mutans* counts. Licorice lollipops have been studied for caries prevention (the licorice compounds may offset sugar exposure, though sugar-free would be better).

**Caution:** High-dose chronic use of glycyrrhizin-containing products can cause hypertension and electrolyte imbalances. Topical oral use is likely safe.

---

## M

### Manuka Honey

**What it is:** Honey produced by bees that pollinate the manuka bush (*Leptospermum scoparium*) native to New Zealand.

**Key compound:** Methylglyoxal (MGO)—responsible for unique antimicrobial activity

**Mechanisms:** Antimicrobial (MGO damages bacterial proteins); promotes wound healing; anti-inflammatory.

**Evidence for oral health:** Moderate. Despite being a sugar, manuka honey has shown antimicrobial effects and wound healing benefits in oral applications. The MGO content distinguishes it from regular honey.

**Paradox:** Yes, it's sugar. The antimicrobial and healing properties may offset this for therapeutic use, but it shouldn't be a daily habit.

---

### Menthol

**What it is:** A monoterpenoid compound found in peppermint and other mint oils.

**Mechanisms:** Mild antimicrobial; activates cold-sensitive receptors (creates cooling sensation); mild analgesic.

**Evidence for oral health:** Moderate-good as part of essential oil mouthwashes. The cooling sensation also promotes the subjective feeling of freshness.

---

### Miswak

**What it is:** A teeth-cleaning twig, traditionally from *Salvadora persica* but also from other species (neem, olive, walnut).

**Key compounds (in *Salvadora persica*):**
- Benzyl isothiocyanate (antimicrobial)
- Silica (abrasive)
- Sodium bicarbonate (pH buffer)
- Sodium chloride (antimicrobial environment)
- Fluoride (~8-22 ppm)
- Vitamin C, sulfur compounds, salvadorine

**Evidence for oral health:** Strong. WHO-recognized as valid alternative to conventional toothbrushing. Multiple comparative studies show equivalent or superior plaque and gingivitis reduction.

**The Tooth Fairy's note:** This is perhaps my favorite botanical intervention. Seven thousand years of use, validated by modern science, containing almost everything a tooth needs in one humble twig.

**See also:** Salvadora persica

---

### Myrrh (*Commiphora myrrha*)

**What it is:** A resin obtained from various *Commiphora* species; used in traditional medicine since ancient times.

**Key compounds:** Terpenoids (furanodienes), polysaccharides

**Mechanisms:** Antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, astringent.

**Evidence for oral health:** Limited modern clinical data, but extensive traditional use. German Commission E approved for mild oral inflammations.

---

## N

### Nano-Hydroxyapatite (n-HAp)

**What it is:** Synthetically produced hydroxyapatite particles at nanoscale (typically 20-100 nm diameter).

**Proposed mechanisms:**
- Direct deposition into enamel defects
- Calcium/phosphate reservoir for remineralization
- Integration into acquired pellicle
- Tubule occlusion for dentin sensitivity

**Evidence for oral health:** Moderate-good. Systematic reviews show non-inferiority to fluoride for remineralization of initial caries lesions. Long-term caries prevention data less robust than for fluoride.

**Products:** Apagard (Japan), various toothpastes marketed in Europe and increasingly worldwide.

**The Tooth Fairy's note:** A legitimate alternative to fluoride with sound science behind it, though fluoride has a longer track record.

---

### Neem (*Azadirachta indica*)

**What it is:** A tree native to the Indian subcontinent; all parts have been used in traditional medicine.

**Key compounds:** Azadirachtin, nimbin, nimbidin, gedunin

**Mechanisms:** Antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory.

**Evidence for oral health:** Moderate. Traditional chew stick use (like miswak); some clinical trials support benefit for gingivitis. Fewer studies than for *Salvadora persica*.

**Products:** Neem toothpastes, mouthwashes, and the traditional twig form.

---

## O

### Oil Pulling

**What it is:** The practice of swishing oil (typically coconut or sesame) in the mouth for 15-20 minutes, then spitting.

**Proposed mechanisms:** Not fully established. May include saponification (soap formation with saliva), physical trapping of bacteria, antimicrobial effects of lauric acid (in coconut oil).

**Evidence for oral health:** Moderate. Several clinical trials show reduced *S. mutans* counts, plaque, and gingivitis—sometimes comparable to chlorhexidine. Mechanism unclear; duration may matter (extended swishing itself may be beneficial).

**See also:** Coconut oil, Lauric acid

---

## P

### Propolis

**What it is:** A resinous substance produced by bees from plant resins, used to seal hives and protect against pathogens.

**Key compounds:** Flavonoids (pinocembrin, galangin), phenolic acids, terpenoids—varies significantly by geographic origin.

**Mechanisms:** Antimicrobial (disrupts bacterial cell division, damages membranes), anti-inflammatory (COX/LOX inhibition), promotes wound healing.

**Evidence for oral health:** Good. Multiple clinical trials show benefit for gingivitis, periodontitis, oral candidiasis, and aphthous ulcers. Some studies show comparable efficacy to chlorhexidine.

**Products:** Tinctures (alcohol-based extract), mouthwashes, toothpastes.

**Caution:** Can cause allergic reactions in sensitive individuals, particularly those allergic to bee products. May stain teeth.

---

## S

### Sage (*Salvia officinalis*)

**What it is:** An herb native to the Mediterranean, used in cooking and medicine since antiquity. The genus name *Salvia* comes from Latin *salvare*, "to save/heal."

**Key compounds:** Thujone, 1,8-cineole (eucalyptol), camphor, rosmarinic acid, carnosic acid

**Mechanisms:** Antimicrobial (terpenoids disrupt membranes), anti-inflammatory, astringent (tannins).

**Evidence for oral health:** Moderate-good. Clinical trials show sage mouthwash reduces *S. mutans* counts comparably to chlorhexidine. German Commission E approved for mouth and throat inflammation.

**Use:** Tea (steep leaves 10-15 minutes), as a rinse.

---

### Salvadora persica

**See:** Miswak

---

### Sodium Bicarbonate

**See:** Baking Soda

---

### Sodium Chloride (Salt, NaCl)

**What it is:** Common table salt.

**Mechanism:** Hypertonic salt solutions create osmotic stress on bacterial cells, drawing water out. Creates an environment less hospitable to bacteria. Also draws fluid from swollen tissues, reducing inflammation.

**Evidence for oral health:** Good. Salt water rinses are standard of care for post-extraction wound healing. Evidence supports use for mild gingival inflammation.

**The Tooth Fairy's note:** The other pillar of my simple rinse. Cheap, effective, and gentler than you might expect.

---

## T

### Tea Tree Oil (*Melaleuca alternifolia*)

**What it is:** Essential oil from the Australian tea tree.

**Key compound:** Terpinen-4-ol

**Mechanism:** Antimicrobial—disrupts bacterial cell membranes; antifungal.

**Evidence for oral health:** Limited oral-specific evidence. Antimicrobial properties well-established, but toxicity concerns limit oral use.

**Caution:** Toxic if swallowed in significant amounts. Medicinal taste. Not recommended for oral rinses at significant concentrations.

---

### Thymol

**What it is:** A monoterpenoid phenol found in thyme oil.

**Mechanism:** Disrupts bacterial cell membranes; one of the most effective essential oil antimicrobials.

**Evidence for oral health:** Strong. One of four active ingredients in Listerine with extensive clinical trial support.

---

## X

### Xylitol

**What it is:** A five-carbon sugar alcohol naturally found in many fruits and vegetables; commercially produced from birch or corn.

**Mechanisms:**
- Non-fermentable by *S. mutans* (they cannot metabolize it to produce acid)
- *S. mutans* take up xylitol, wasting energy trying to process it—"futile cycling"
- May disrupt *S. mutans* adhesion
- Stimulates saliva flow

**Evidence for oral health:** Strong. Multiple systematic reviews support caries-preventive effect. Optimal exposure is approximately 5-6g daily, divided across multiple exposures.

**Products:** Gum, mints, toothpastes, rinses.

**The Tooth Fairy's note:** This is a genuinely prebiotic intervention—you're not killing bacteria, you're starving the problematic ones while providing a substrate they can't use. Smart, not scorched-earth.

---

## Z

### Zinc

**What it is:** An essential trace mineral.

**Mechanism:** In oral products, zinc salts (zinc chloride, zinc citrate) have antimicrobial effects and reduce volatile sulfur compound production (anti-halitosis).

**Evidence for oral health:** Moderate for anti-halitosis effects. Zinc is a component of some commercial mouthwashes and toothpastes.
