# Keep Your Teeth!

## What the Tooth Fairy Has Been Trying to Tell You

![The Tooth Fairy welcomes you to her apothecary.](./images/tooth-fairy/welcome.webp){ width=400 align=right }

Your mouth isn't a war zone. It's an **ecosystem**, like a coral reef or a garden (if you want to get poetic about it).

There are hundreds of species of bacteria in there, and a *lot* of them are trying to help you. When you napalm the whole system with antiseptic mouthwash, you don't create health. You create chaos.

This book is about understanding what's actually happening in your mouth every hour of every day—and working *with* it rather than against it.

**Are you ready to start listening?**
