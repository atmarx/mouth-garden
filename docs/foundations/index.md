## What's Actually Happening in Your Mouth

---

*In which the Tooth Fairy explains that your teeth are not passive objects waiting to be cleaned, but dynamic crystalline structures engaged in a constant chemical negotiation with their environment—and that understanding this negotiation is the key to everything that follows.*

Before we can talk about what to do, we need to talk about what's happening.

Most people think of their teeth the way they think of their car: a thing they own that needs occasional maintenance, predictable servicing, and the occasional repair when something goes wrong. This is understandable. It's also almost entirely wrong.

Your teeth are alive in a way that might surprise you. Not alive like your heart or your liver—they don't pump or filter or regenerate dramatically. But they're not inert either. Every moment of every day, the outer surface of your teeth is engaged in a chemical conversation with everything it touches: saliva, food, drinks, bacteria, the very air in your mouth.

This conversation has two possible outcomes. Either your teeth are dissolving, molecule by molecule, losing the mineral structure that makes them hard and functional. Or they're rebuilding, reclaiming minerals from the fluid surrounding them, growing stronger and more resistant.

Which direction the conversation goes depends on chemistry—specifically, on pH, on mineral concentrations, on time, and on the bacterial communities that call your mouth home. These aren't mystical forces. They're predictable, understandable, and to a remarkable degree, controllable.

In this first section, I want to give you the foundation you need to understand everything that comes later. We'll start with enamel itself: what it's made of, why it dissolves, and how it rebuilds. We'll explore saliva, the fluid you produce constantly and probably take entirely for granted, which turns out to be a supersaturated repair solution engineered by evolution specifically to protect your teeth. We'll meet the bacterial communities that live in your mouth—not as enemies to be destroyed, but as an ecosystem to be understood and managed. And we'll talk about the tongue, that often-forgotten bacterial reservoir that plays a larger role in oral health than most people realize.

By the end of this section, you'll see your mouth differently. Not as a problem to be solved or a battle to be won, but as a system to be understood.

And understanding, I promise, is the first step to keeping your teeth exactly where they are.
