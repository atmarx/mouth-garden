# Chapter 33: Raising Resilient Teeth

Children occupy a special place in my work. Their baby teeth are temporary—I'll collect them eventually regardless—but those primary teeth matter far more than people realize. And their permanent teeth, the ones that need to last 70+ years, are forming and erupting during a critical window when habits get established and enamel is most vulnerable.

Get childhood oral care right, and you set a human up for a lifetime of healthy teeth. Get it wrong, and I'll be making many more visits than either of us would prefer.

## Why Children Are Different

### Developing Enamel

When permanent teeth first erupt, their enamel is immature—less mineralized, more porous, more susceptible to acid attack. It takes 2-3 years after eruption for enamel to fully mature through post-eruptive maturation (continued mineralization from saliva and fluoride exposure).

This means newly erupted permanent teeth are at *higher* caries risk than mature adult enamel. The 6-year molars, 12-year molars, and other permanent teeth are most vulnerable right after they appear.

### Higher Sugar Exposure

Children typically consume more frequent sugar exposures than adults:
- Snacks between meals
- Juice boxes
- Sweet drinks
- Candy and treats
- Sugar in school lunches

Each sugar exposure is an acid attack. Children's eating patterns often mean more attacks per day than adults experience.

### Less Developed Manual Dexterity

Young children literally can't brush effectively. The fine motor control required for proper technique isn't fully developed until around age 8-10. Before that, adult supervision and assistance is essential—children may think they've brushed adequately when they've only done a cursory job.

### The Primary Teeth Matter

"They're just baby teeth, they'll fall out anyway"—I've heard this sentiment countless times, and it frustrates me deeply.

Primary teeth matter because:

1. **They maintain space for permanent teeth.** Early loss of primary teeth allows neighboring teeth to drift, causing crowding and orthodontic problems when permanent teeth erupt.

2. **Infections spread.** Abscessed primary teeth can damage developing permanent teeth below them.

3. **Eating and nutrition.** Children need functional teeth to eat properly.

4. **Speech development.** Teeth are involved in speech sound production.

5. **Habit formation.** The habits established around primary teeth carry into permanent dentition.

6. **Self-esteem.** Children with visible decay may be teased and develop negative associations with their appearance.

## Age-Specific Guidance

### Infancy (0-1 year)

**Before teeth erupt:**
- Wipe gums with a clean, damp cloth after feeding
- This establishes the habit and reduces bacterial colonization

**When first teeth appear (usually 6-10 months):**
- Begin brushing with a soft infant toothbrush
- Use a tiny smear of fluoride toothpaste (rice grain size)
- Brush twice daily
- No bottles in bed with milk or juice (nursing caries risk)

### Toddlers (1-3 years)

**Brushing:**
- Continue twice daily brushing
- Smear/rice grain amount of fluoride toothpaste
- Parent does the brushing; child can "help" but parent finishes
- Make it fun—songs, games, special toothbrushes

**Diet:**
- Limit juice (AAP recommends ≤4 oz/day for 1-3 year olds)
- No sipping juice or milk throughout day
- Water between meals
- Avoid sticky candies

**First dental visit:**
- By age 1 or within 6 months of first tooth (AAP/AAPD recommendation)
- Establishes dental home, identifies risk factors early

### Preschool (3-6 years)

**Brushing:**
- Pea-sized amount of fluoride toothpaste
- Parent still supervises and assists
- Teach spitting (children often swallow toothpaste)
- Morning and bedtime brushing

**Flossing:**
- Begin when teeth touch (often around age 2-3)
- Parent does the flossing
- Floss picks can be easier than traditional floss for small mouths

**Diet:**
- Continue limiting sugary drinks
- Be aware of hidden sugars in snacks
- Encourage water as primary beverage
- Limit snacking frequency

**First permanent molars:**
- 6-year molars erupt behind baby teeth (no tooth falls out for them)
- Often missed because parents don't realize they're there
- High caries risk—newly erupted, difficult to reach, deep grooves
- Consider sealants (see below)

### School Age (6-12 years)

**Brushing:**
- Child can brush independently but parent should check
- Electric toothbrushes can help
- Timer or app to ensure 2-minute duration
- Continue emphasizing "spit, don't rinse"

**Flossing:**
- Transition to child doing it with supervision
- Water flossers can be easier and more engaging

**Sealants:**
- Dental sealants are plastic coatings applied to chewing surfaces of molars
- They fill the deep grooves where bacteria hide and brushing can't reach
- Highly effective caries prevention (80%+ reduction in treated surfaces)
- Should be applied soon after molar eruption (6-year and 12-year molars)
- I *strongly* recommend sealants—one of the most effective preventive interventions available

**Orthodontics:**
- If braces are placed, oral hygiene becomes much more challenging
- Plaque accumulates around brackets
- Special brushes, water flossers, and possibly more frequent professional cleanings
- Higher caries and gingivitis risk during treatment
- Consider CPP-ACP (MI Paste) for additional protection

### Teenagers (12-18 years)

**The challenge:** Parental influence wanes; peer influence rises. Many teens neglect oral care, consume lots of sugar and acidic drinks, and don't prioritize dental visits.

**Strategies:**
- Appeal to aesthetics (white teeth, fresh breath)
- Link oral health to overall appearance and confidence
- Make supplies accessible (keep toothbrush at school if needed)
- Sports drinks and energy drinks are highly acidic—limit them
- If they won't floss, push water flosser as alternative

**Wisdom teeth:**
- Third molars typically erupt 17-25
- May need extraction if impacted or problematic
- If retained, they're hard to clean and often develop caries

## The Fluoride Question for Children

This is where the fluoride controversy matters most. Children's developing teeth can be affected by both too little and too much fluoride.

### Systemic Fluoride (Swallowed)

**Benefit:** Incorporates into developing enamel, making teeth stronger before they even erupt.

**Risk:** Excess systemic fluoride during enamel formation (roughly 0-8 years) can cause dental fluorosis—white spots or, in severe cases, brown mottling.

**Sources:**
- Fluoridated water (0.7 ppm in US)
- Swallowed toothpaste
- Fluoride supplements (by prescription)

### Topical Fluoride (Contact with Erupted Teeth)

**Benefit:** Creates fluorapatite in enamel surface; accelerates remineralization.

**Risk:** Minimal from appropriate use.

**Sources:**
- Fluoride toothpaste
- Fluoride rinses
- Professional fluoride applications

### Practical Guidance

**If you have fluoridated water:**
- Use fluoride toothpaste in age-appropriate amounts
- Supervise brushing to minimize swallowing
- No supplements needed
- Some fluorosis risk, but usually mild and cosmetic

**If you have unfluoridated water (well, RO system, etc.):**
- Fluoride toothpaste is more important
- Consider discussing supplements with pediatric dentist
- Professional fluoride varnish applications more valuable
- Monitor for caries development

**The RO system you mentioned:** Your children aren't getting systemic fluoride from drinking water. This makes:
- Fluoride toothpaste use more important
- Professional fluoride applications more valuable
- Possibly worth discussing supplements with a dentist
- Not a crisis, but worth awareness

### The Swallowing Problem

Young children often swallow toothpaste instead of spitting it. This is why:
- Use only a rice grain/smear amount until age 3
- Use pea-sized amount ages 3-6
- Teach spitting early
- Don't use "tasty" toothpastes that encourage swallowing
- Supervise brushing

## Diet: The Hidden Battlefield

**Sugar frequency matters more than total amount.** Five small sugar exposures (candy, cookie, juice box, soda, sweet snack) create more acid attacks than one larger dessert.

**Teach children:**
- Water is the default beverage
- Juice is a treat, not a daily drink
- Candy happens, but preferably with meals or in limited time windows, not spread throughout the day
- If you're going to have sweets, eat them and be done—don't stretch it out

**School challenges:**
- Pack water, not juice boxes
- Limit sweet snacks in lunches
- Chocolate milk at lunch is a sugar exposure
- After-school snacks should be low-caries risk when possible (cheese, vegetables, nuts)

**The bedtime bottle disaster:**
- Putting a child to bed with a bottle of milk or juice is extremely cariogenic
- The liquid pools around teeth while saliva flow is reduced
- "Baby bottle tooth decay" devastates primary teeth
- If a bottle is needed for comfort, it should contain only water

## Building Lifetime Habits

The habits established in childhood tend to persist. A child who grows up brushing twice daily, flossing, seeing the dentist regularly, and limiting sugar will likely continue those patterns as an adult.

**Make it normal:**
- Oral care is just what we do, not a negotiation
- Parents model good behavior
- Regular dental visits from early age normalize them

**Make it achievable:**
- Age-appropriate expectations
- Don't expect perfection
- Praise effort and consistency

**Make it positive:**
- Not a chore, just part of the routine
- Celebrate dental visit success
- Don't use dentist as threat ("brush or the dentist will drill your teeth")

## When to See a Specialist

**Pediatric dentists** specialize in children's oral health. Consider them for:
- First dental visit
- Children with anxiety about dentists
- Children with special needs
- Complex treatment needs
- If regular dentist isn't comfortable with young children

**Orthodontic evaluation** typically recommended around age 7 to identify developing problems, even if treatment won't happen until later.

## What I Wish Every Parent Knew

After watching countless children's teeth, here's what matters most:

1. **Primary teeth matter.** Don't dismiss them as temporary.

2. **Supervise brushing until age 8-10.** Children cannot do it effectively alone.

3. **Fluoride toothpaste from first tooth.** The benefits outweigh fluorosis concerns with appropriate amounts.

4. **Limit sugar frequency.** It's the pattern, not just the quantity.

5. **Get sealants.** On 6-year and 12-year molars. Highly effective, underutilized.

6. **Establish dental home early.** First visit by age 1.

7. **Water, not juice.** As the default beverage.

8. **Never bottles in bed with anything but water.** This single practice prevents enormous suffering.

Your children's teeth are my future workload—or not. The habits you establish now determine whether I'll be collecting their teeth for decades to come or whether they'll keep them for a lifetime.

I'd rather be unemployed. Help me out here.
