# Part V: Delivery — Getting Solutions Where They Need to Go

I've given you wonderful formulations. I've explained the chemistry. You understand, now, why salt water isn't just folk wisdom and why baking soda actually shifts the ecological balance. You have recipes for rinses that work with your oral ecosystem rather than against it.

But here's a problem I see all the time: people swish their carefully prepared rinse around their mouth for thirty seconds, spit, and call it done. And most of that rinse never touched the surfaces that matter most.

Your teeth aren't smooth. Your gums have crevices. Between your teeth are spaces that liquid doesn't naturally penetrate. And deep in those gingival sulci—the little gutters where your gums meet your teeth—that's where the trouble often starts. A casual swish leaves these areas untouched.

Getting oral care products to the right places requires understanding two things: the architecture of the problem (what you're up against) and the physics of the solution (how to deliver things effectively).

In this section, we'll talk about mechanical disruption—physically breaking up the biofilms that protect bacteria from whatever you're trying to deliver. We'll explore water flossers and why they're genuinely useful devices, not just expensive squirt guns. And we'll put it together into protocols that combine mechanical disruption with your ecological rinses for maximum effect.

The best solution in the world doesn't help if it never reaches the problem. Let's talk about delivery.
