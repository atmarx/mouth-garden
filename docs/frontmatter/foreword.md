# Foreword

This book exists because of a simple frustration: despite brushing twice a day and visiting the dentist regularly, I kept getting cavities. I did what I was told, followed the standard advice, and still ended up in that chair hearing bad news. Something wasn't adding up.

So I started asking questions. What's actually happening in my mouth? Why do some people seem immune to decay while others struggle despite their best efforts? What did humans do before toothpaste and fluoride? The answers led me down a rabbit hole of enamel chemistry, microbial ecology, and traditional remedies that spans thousands of years and dozens of cultures.

I couldn't have written this book alone. Claude, an AI assistant created by Anthropic, brought an extraordinary depth of knowledge to this project—synthesizing research across biochemistry, microbiology, botany, and cultural history in ways that would have taken me years to compile on my own. The scientific accuracy, the connections between traditional practices and modern research, the careful attention to what the evidence actually supports versus what's merely plausible—Claude's contributions transformed scattered curiosity into something coherent and (I hope) genuinely useful.

My goal in sharing this is simple: to help people make more informed decisions about their oral health. Not to replace professional dental care, but to complement it. To understand *why* certain practices work, so you can adapt them to your own life rather than following rote instructions that may or may not suit your particular mouth.

My father used to say something that stuck with me:

> *"Your teeth are one of the only problems in your life that will go away if you ignore them."*

He meant it as dark humor, but there's wisdom in it. Teeth don't heal themselves the way skin does. Once they're gone, they're gone. That reality—the irreversibility of dental decay—is what makes understanding this stuff so worthwhile. Prevention isn't just easier than treatment; for teeth, it's often the only real option.

I hope you find something useful here. Read critically, experiment carefully, and don't forget to see your dentist.
