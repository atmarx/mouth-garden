## This Is Not Medical Advice

The information provided in *Tending Your Mouth Garden* is for **educational and informational purposes only**. It is not intended to be a substitute for professional medical or dental advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

**Always seek the advice of your dentist, physician, or other qualified health provider** with any questions you may have regarding a medical condition or treatment. Never disregard professional advice or delay in seeking it because of something you have read on this website or in this book.

## No Professional Relationship

Reading this material does not establish a dentist-patient, doctor-patient, or any other professional-client relationship between you and the authors. The Tooth Fairy, despite millennia of experience, is not a licensed healthcare provider in any jurisdiction.

---

## Individual Variation

Oral health is highly individual. What works well for one person may not work for another. Factors including genetics, existing conditions, medications, diet, and lifestyle all affect outcomes. The protocols and recommendations discussed here are general in nature and may not be appropriate for your specific situation.

Before trying any new oral care regimen—especially herbal preparations, supplements, or significant changes to your routine—consult with a qualified healthcare professional who knows your medical history.

## Regarding Children, Pregnancy, and Special Populations

- Children under 6 years of age
- Pregnant or breastfeeding individuals
- People with compromised immune systems
- Those taking multiple medications
- Anyone with chronic health conditions

## Scientific Limitations

The field of oral health research is evolving. Some information presented here may become outdated as new research emerges. We have made every effort to accurately represent the current state of evidence, but science is a process of ongoing discovery and revision.

Where evidence is limited or conflicting, we have tried to indicate this clearly. The evidence hierarchy in [Appendix C](../reference/evidence-hierarchy.md) explains how we evaluate and communicate the strength of different claims.

## Summary

Read this material as you would any educational resource: with interest, with critical thinking, and with the understanding that your dentist and doctor know your mouth and body far better than any book can.

We wrote this to help you understand oral health more deeply—not to replace the professionals who can examine, diagnose, and treat you as an individual.

*Take care of your garden. And let the professionals help you tend it.*
