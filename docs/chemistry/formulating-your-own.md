# Chapter 14: Formulating Your Own

Now we get practical. I've given you the chemistry; I've explained the mechanisms; I've warned you about what doesn't work. In this chapter, I'm going to give you actual recipes—formulations you can make tonight with ingredients you probably already have.

These aren't proprietary secrets. They're combinations of simple, evidence-based ingredients, optimized for different situations. Think of them as starting points that you can adjust based on your own needs and preferences.

I'll organize these from simplest to most elaborate, and I'll tell you when to use each one.

## The Foundation: Basic Dry Mix

This is your everyday workhorse. Make a batch, store it in a jar, and it'll last indefinitely.

**Ingredients:**
- 4 tablespoons fine salt (any kind)
- 2 tablespoons baking soda
- 1 tablespoon calcium carbonate powder (optional)

**Method:**
1. Combine all ingredients in a clean, dry jar
2. Shake or stir to mix thoroughly
3. Store with a tight-fitting lid in a dry place

**To use:**
Add ½ to 1 teaspoon to 8 ounces of warm water. Stir until dissolved (the calcium carbonate won't fully dissolve—that's expected). Swish for 30-60 seconds, spit.

**When to use:**
- Daily maintenance (once or twice per day)
- After meals
- Before bed
- Whenever you want a gentle, ecological rinse

This is your default. Everything else builds on this.

## The Post-Meal Quick Rinse

When you've just eaten and want to neutralize acid quickly, you don't need the full formulation. This is stripped-down and fast.

**Ingredients:**
- 8 ounces water (warm or room temperature)
- ¼ teaspoon baking soda

That's it. Just baking soda and water.

**Method:**
Stir the baking soda into the water until dissolved. Swish for 15-30 seconds. Spit.

**Why this works:**
The primary goal after eating is pH buffering—neutralizing the acid that bacteria are producing from the sugars you just consumed. Baking soda does this efficiently. You don't need the salt (osmotic effects aren't the priority here) or essential oils (you're going for speed, not antibacterial action).

**When to use:**
- Immediately after meals or snacks
- After drinking acidic beverages (wine, citrus juice, soda)
- After consuming sugary foods
- Any time you want quick acid neutralization

Keep a small container of baking soda at work or in your bag for on-the-go use. A quarter teaspoon is about what you can pinch between three fingers.

## The Sore Gum Soother

When your gums are inflamed, tender, or recovering from a procedure, you want the anti-edema effects of salt plus some anti-inflammatory botanical support.

**Ingredients:**
- 8 ounces warm water
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon baking soda
- 1 teaspoon dried sage leaves, steeped (or use pre-made sage tea as the water base)
- Optional: 5-10 drops propolis tincture

**Method 1 (sage tea base):**
1. Make a strong sage tea: steep 1 tablespoon dried sage in 8 ounces hot water for 10-15 minutes
2. Strain and let cool to warm (not hot)
3. Add salt and baking soda
4. Stir until dissolved
5. Add propolis tincture if using
6. Use within 24 hours (store in refrigerator)

**Method 2 (quick version):**
1. Add dried sage leaves directly to warm water
2. Let steep 5 minutes
3. Add salt and baking soda
4. Strain through a fine mesh strainer or cheesecloth
5. Use immediately

**When to use:**
- After dental procedures (extractions, deep cleanings)
- During periodontal flare-ups
- For canker sores or mouth ulcers
- When gums are puffy, red, or tender
- During recovery from any oral injury

**Why this works:**
The salt draws fluid out of swollen tissue. The sage contains anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial compounds. The propolis (if included) adds wound-healing support. Together, they create a soothing, healing environment.

**Note:** If you're post-surgical, check with your dentist about when to start rinsing. Typically, gentle salt rinses can begin 24 hours after extraction, but follow your provider's specific instructions.

## The Antimicrobial Boost

When you need something stronger than the basic rinse—perhaps you're fighting early gingivitis or just want extra antimicrobial action—this adds essential oils to the mix.

**Ingredients:**
- 8 ounces warm water
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon baking soda
- ½ teaspoon vegetable glycerin
- 1 drop peppermint essential oil
- 1 drop thyme OR eucalyptus essential oil

**Method:**
1. In a small bowl or cup, combine the vegetable glycerin with the essential oils. Stir to blend.
2. Add the warm water
3. Add salt and baking soda
4. Stir well—the glycerin helps disperse the oils, but shake or stir before each use anyway
5. Use within a week (essential oils can degrade)

**When to use:**
- When you want additional antimicrobial action
- If you're seeing early signs of gum inflammation
- As an occasional "deep clean" rinse (not necessarily daily)
- Before social situations where you want extra-fresh breath

**Why this works:**
The essential oils add genuine antimicrobial activity on top of the ecological benefits of the salt and baking soda. The thymol in thyme oil and the eucalyptol in eucalyptus oil are the same compounds used in Listerine, but at lower concentrations and without the alcohol burn.

## The Breath Freshener

Sometimes the goal is specifically fresh breath. This formulation targets the volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs) that cause halitosis.

**Ingredients:**
- 8 ounces strong green tea (cooled to warm)
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon baking soda
- 1 drop peppermint essential oil
- Optional: ½ teaspoon xylitol (for sweetness)

**Method:**
1. Brew strong green tea (2 bags or 2 teaspoons loose leaf in 8 ounces water, steep 5 minutes)
2. Let cool to warm
3. Add salt, baking soda, xylitol if using
4. Add peppermint oil
5. Stir well
6. Use within 24 hours (refrigerate if storing)

**When to use:**
- Before social or professional situations
- First thing in the morning
- Any time breath freshness is a priority

**Why this works:**
Green tea catechins (especially EGCG) reduce VSC production by inhibiting the bacteria that produce them.[^1] The alkaline pH from baking soda also disfavors VSC-producing organisms. Peppermint adds immediate freshness. Xylitol adds pleasant sweetness without feeding cariogenic bacteria.

## The Concentrated Travel Formula

When you're traveling and can't carry liquids, this dry concentrate packs into a tiny container.

**Ingredients:**
- 2 tablespoons fine salt
- 1 tablespoon baking soda
- ½ tablespoon xylitol powder (optional, for taste)

**To use:**
Pinch a small amount (about ⅛ to ¼ teaspoon) into your mouth. Add a sip of water. Swish the resulting solution around your mouth. Spit.

Alternatively, dissolve in a small cup of water if one is available.

**Packaging:**
Store in a tiny container—an old mint tin works well, or a small pill case. This is TSA-friendly (it's just salt and baking soda) and lightweight.

**When to use:**
- Hotel rooms
- Airplanes (ask for a cup of water)
- Camping
- Any situation where you're away from your normal setup

## The Remineralization Support Rinse

If remineralization is your specific goal—perhaps you have early white spot lesions or are in post-orthodontic recovery—this formulation maximizes mineral support.

**Ingredients:**
- 8 ounces warm water
- ¼ teaspoon calcium carbonate powder
- ⅛ teaspoon food-grade calcium phosphite or monocalcium phosphate (if available)
- ¼ teaspoon baking soda
- Pinch of salt

**Method:**
1. Add all powders to warm water
2. Stir vigorously—neither calcium compound will fully dissolve, creating a suspension
3. Swish for 60 seconds, making sure the suspended particles contact tooth surfaces
4. Spit
5. Try not to rinse with plain water immediately after—let the residue sit on teeth

**Important timing:**
Use this 30+ minutes after brushing with fluoride toothpaste. You don't want to wash away the fluoride, and you want the remineralization support to follow the fluoride exposure for potential synergy.

**Realistic expectations:**
As I discussed in Chapter 11, the amount of calcium and phosphate you're delivering this way is modest compared to what saliva provides. This is a support, not a miracle. For serious remineralization needs, products like MI Paste (CPP-ACP) or nano-hydroxyapatite toothpastes may be more effective. But this is a low-cost option that probably helps at the margins.

## The Clove Oil Spot Treatment

This isn't a rinse—it's a localized treatment for acute dental pain.

**Ingredients:**
- Clove essential oil
- Cotton swab or small cotton ball
- Optional: carrier oil (olive oil, coconut oil) for dilution

**Method:**
1. Dip a cotton swab in clove oil (just enough to moisten the tip)
2. If the oil feels too strong, dilute by dipping in carrier oil after
3. Apply directly to the painful area—the tooth, the gum around it, or both
4. Hold in place for 30-60 seconds if tolerable
5. Remove and spit out excess oil
6. Repeat every 2-3 hours as needed

**When to use:**
- Toothache while awaiting dental appointment
- Post-procedure pain
- Sensitivity flare-ups
- Any acute dental pain situation

**Cautions:**
- Don't use on broken skin or open wounds
- Don't swallow significant amounts
- Don't use for more than a few days continuously—if pain persists, see a dentist
- If burning occurs, dilute more heavily or discontinue

**Why this works:**
Eugenol genuinely numbs tissue through sodium channel blockade.[^2] This isn't placebo; it's pharmacology. But it's temporary relief, not treatment—you still need to address the underlying cause.

## Storage and Shelf Life

**Dry mixes (salt, baking soda, calcium carbonate):** Indefinite, as long as they stay dry. Store in airtight containers away from humidity.

**Water-based rinses:** 24-48 hours at room temperature, up to a week refrigerated. The concern isn't the salt or baking soda (those are preservatives themselves) but bacterial growth in the water and degradation of any botanical additives.

**Rinses with essential oils:** Use within one week. Essential oils can oxidize and lose potency. Make fresh batches frequently.

**Herbal tea bases (sage, green tea):** Use within 24 hours, refrigerated. Tea can grow mold surprisingly quickly.

**Pre-mixed glycerin/essential oil blends:** These can last longer—weeks to months if stored in dark glass bottles in a cool place. Make a concentrated blend and add to fresh water as needed.

## Quality of Ingredients

**Salt:** Any food-grade salt works. Pink Himalayan salt is fine if you like it; regular table salt is equally effective. Avoid "salt" products with added flavors or other ingredients.

**Baking soda:** Fresh baking soda works best. Test yours: add a spoonful to vinegar. If it fizzes vigorously, it's active. If the fizz is weak, replace it. Old baking soda loses its buffering capacity.

**Calcium carbonate:** Food-grade calcium carbonate powder is available online and at health food stores. It's also sold as a supplement and as an antite (the active ingredient in Tums is calcium carbonate). Make sure it's pure, without added flavors or binders.

**Essential oils:** Quality matters here. Look for oils that are:

- 100% pure (no synthetic fragrances)
- From reputable suppliers
- Stored in dark glass bottles
- Not expired

Avoid oils sold in clear plastic bottles (light degrades them) or oils with "fragrance" or "perfume" on the label (these are synthetic). You don't need to buy the most expensive therapeutic-grade oils, but you do need actual essential oils, not fragrance oils.

**Glycerin:** Food-grade vegetable glycerin, available at pharmacies and online. It should be clear, odorless, and slightly sweet.

**Propolis:** If using propolis tincture, look for high-concentration products (30-40% propolis) from reputable beekeeping suppliers. Propolis quality varies significantly based on the bees' botanical sources.

## Customization Principles

These formulations are starting points. Feel free to adjust based on:

**Your sensitivity:** If any rinse causes irritation, reduce the concentration of the offending ingredient. Some people are more sensitive to essential oils than others. Some find higher salt concentrations uncomfortable.

**Your taste preferences:** Hate the taste of thyme? Use eucalyptus instead. Find peppermint too intense? Try spearmint, which is milder. The best rinse is one you'll actually use consistently.

**Your specific needs:** Prone to gum inflammation? Emphasize the anti-inflammatory botanicals. Worried about cavities? Focus on pH buffering and consider adding xylitol. Bad breath issues? Add green tea and emphasize the breath-freshening formulation.

**Seasonal adjustments:** You might want warming, spicier formulations in winter (add a hint of cinnamon oil) and cooling ones in summer (more peppermint).

The point is to understand the principles well enough that you can create your own variations confidently. You don't need to follow recipes slavishly—you need to understand what each ingredient contributes so you can adjust intelligently.

## What These Rinses Can and Cannot Do

Let me be clear about realistic expectations:

**These rinses CAN:**
- Create a pH environment that favors enamel stability
- Provide temporary osmotic stress to reduce bacterial activity
- Reduce gingival inflammation modestly
- Provide symptomatic relief for minor oral discomfort
- Support healing after procedures or injuries
- Freshen breath
- Complement (not replace) mechanical cleaning and fluoride use

**These rinses CANNOT:**
- Reverse established cavities
- Cure periodontal disease
- Replace brushing and flossing
- Substitute for fluoride if you're at caries risk
- Fix structural dental problems
- Eliminate the need for professional care

Use them as part of a comprehensive approach, not as a magic solution. They're tools in a toolkit, not silver bullets.

In the next section, we'll talk about how to get these rinses (and anything else you're using) to actually reach the places where they're needed. Because the best formulation in the world doesn't help if it never contacts the surfaces you're trying to protect.
